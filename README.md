# Hospital Management System

## Description

The "Hospital Management System" is a sophisticated Java application engineered to 
revolutionize the management of patient, staff, and appointment data within a hospital setting. 
Utilizing JDBC connectivity to seamlessly interact with a MySQL database, this system delivers an 
intuitive and efficient user interface tailored to meet the diverse needs of hospital administrators. 
Central to its functionality is the "HospitalManagementSystem" class, which serves as the 
cornerstone for establishing database connectivity and orchestrating interactions through an 
instance of the "ManagementManager" class. This managerial component operates as the backbone 
of the system, facilitating essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and table 
creation while upholding stringent data integrity standards.
